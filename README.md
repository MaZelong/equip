# FEARLESSGERBIL


### Setup

Do the following before beginning:

- Do `npm install` in the server folder
- Do `bower install` in the client folder 

### Guidelines

- There are two sceenshots in the assets folder.
  One is business-side UI:
  ![Alt text](/app/assets/BusinessUI.png?raw=true "Business-Side UI") 
  The other one is client-side UI:
  ![Alt text](/app/assets/ClientUI.png?raw=true "Client-Side UI") 

- In the server folder, run `npm test` could test server api and database.
  Add you own test in the test folder if you want to make some changes to routes or database.

- Reference API_ROUTES.md and DATABASE_SCHEMA.md documentations when you
  want to make some updates on the front-end side.
